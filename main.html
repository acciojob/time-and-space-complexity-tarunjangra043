    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time that an algorithm takes to complete. It helps in determining the efficiency of an algorithm by evaluating how the runtime grows as the size of the input increases. Efficient algorithms are those with lower time complexity.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. It is crucial to consider space complexity, especially for large input sizes. Common space complexities include O(1), O(n), and O(n^2), with O(n) indicating that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
